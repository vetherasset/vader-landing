The stablecoin, USDV, is issued by burning VADER tokens. Liquidity pools either use USDV and VADER as the settlement asset, with a zero-slippage conversion available between the two. A daily emission rate of VADER funds liquidity incentives, a protocol interest rate, impermanent loss protection and a float to facilitate protocol lending. Synthetic assets are minted from liquidity pool shares which are eligible to earn an interest rate, as well as being collateral for borrowing debt against. The collateral is used to pay an interest rate which is added into the pools to increase returns.\n\t\t\t\t</Box>\n\n\t\t\t\t<Heading as='h2' size='xs'>Introduction</Heading>\n\t\t\t\t<Box as='p' textAlign='justify' textStyle='p'>\n\t\t\t\tStablecoins and synthetic assets are a noble problem to solve. The key problem is a matter of liquidity and sensing the correct purchasing power of assets at all times. In addition, the use of incentives can\n\t\t\t\tensure the maximum uptake of the system and the fast bootstrapping of capital. Existing stablecoms\n\t\t\t\tand synthetic asset designs fall short because they use oracles that are not liquidity sensitive and can\n\t\t\t\tbe manipulated, do not incentivise the makers of liquidity properly, and are not natively interest-bearing.\n\t\t\t\t</Box>\n\n\t\t\t\t<Box as='p' textAlign='justify' textStyle='p'>\n\t\t\t\tVader is a new form of liquidity protocol that seeks to be self-serving. It uses its own liquidity and awareness of asset purchasing power to support the creation of a collateralized stablecoin. It also is\n\t\t\t\tcapable of using liquidity units as collateral for synthetic assets, of which it will always have\n\t\t\t\tguaranteed redemption liquidity for. It has a fair and transparent incentive strategy to maximise the\n\t\t\t\tdepth of liquidity pools and adoption of synthetic assets.

When\nsynths are swapped back to a token, they are burnt, a pro-rata share of units are deleted, and the base\nasset is moved out.

This will stop a build up\nof members who have consumed all their collateral in interest, but never leave, which adversely\naffects the accounting for the remaining members.\n\t\t\t\t</Box>\n\t\t\t\t<Box as='p' textAlign='justify' textStyle='p'>\n\t\t\t\tThe share of interest is tracked by an accumulator which multiplies time by collateral sizing\n(priceTime).

This is to ensure the emission rate of VADER is\nprogrammed and immutable, and is not dependent on downstream requirements. As such, under heavy\ndemand, the Reserve can go to 0, in which case incentives, protection and lending will stop for the\nrest of the day.
